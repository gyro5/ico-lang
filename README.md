# Ico Language

Ico is a dynamically typed and procedural scripting language where only special characters on a standard keyboard are used for built-in operators and "keywords". It is meant to be an experimental language, made mainly for my learning purposes. Although it is a toy language, Ico is a fully working programming language, with an interactive REPL and a script interpreter.

## Credits & Inspiration

The code is based on the `clox` implementation of the Lox language from the amazing book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom. However, Ico is a completely different language with its own syntax and features, as you can see in the sections below.

Some syntax and features of Ico are also inspired by Lua, Python, and Haskell.
