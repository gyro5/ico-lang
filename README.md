# Simbolo Language

Simbolo is a dynamically typed and procedural scripting language where only special characters are used for built-in operators and "keywords". It is meant to be a fun and experimental but not very useful language, made mainly for my learning purposes.

## Credits & Inspiration

The code is based on the `clox` implementation of the Lox language from the amazing book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom. However, Simbolo is a completely different language with its own syntax and features, as you can see in the sections below.

Some syntax and features of Simbolo are inspired by Lua and Haskell.
